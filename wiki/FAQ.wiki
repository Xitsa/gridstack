#summary How to use GridStack

= How to use GridStack =
First, you should write a special text file, describing window layout.
Usually I save it with an extension *stack*. Suppose, that it has name *my.stack*.
To get a corresponding grid call _gridstack_ in such manner:
`GridStack my.stack my.grid`
= How to define desired layout =
I try to show it by example.

Look at the picture. On left top corner is a desired layout.

Defining layout is iterative process of dissecting windows on vertical or horizontal parts.

Lets start with empty window. Thats easy, monitor one has one window, that fills all.
{{{
Monitor 1
    Window
}}}
Now split Window on two horizontal parts A and B. Let width of A be 3 times width of B (and the same height).
So let substitute window by a HStack construction:
{{{
Monitor 1
    HStack
        (
            Window 3 #Part A
            Window 1 #Part B
        )
}}}
Now split Part A on two vertical parts C and D. And let height of C be 2 times of D (and the same width).
{{{
Monitor 1
    HStack
        (
            VStack 3 #Part A
                (
                    Window 2 #Part C
                    Window 1 #Part D
                )
            Window 1 #Part B
        )
}}}
Part C doesn't need any divisions, so let proceed with a part D, that needed to be split on three horizontal parts.
Lets make them the same. Please note, that if relative size is equal one, it can be omitted.
{{{
Monitor 1
    HStack
        (
            VStack 3 #Part A
                (
                    Window 2 #Part C
                    HStack 1 #Part D
                        (
                            Window #Part E
                            Window #Part F
                            Window #Part G
                        )
                )
            Window 1 #Part B
        )
}}}
We are almost done, and have only part B needed to be split on three vertical parts H, I and J.
{{{
Monitor 1
    HStack
        (
            VStack 3 #Part A
                (
                    Window 2 #Part C
                    HStack 1 #Part D
                        (
                            Window #Part E
                            Window #Part F
                            Window #Part G
                        )
                )
            VStack 1 #Part B
                (
                    Window #Part H
                    Window #Part I
                    Window #Part J
                )
        )
}}}
== What if I want exact size? ==
If, for example you want parts E, F and G have height 200 pixels use absolute notation: *`<number>!`* (with an exclamation mark).

Between number and '!' must not be any spaces!
